This is me, Gunnar, who's always struggled with GitHub.

I am so sorry about if this bugs up anything I haven't Used Branches on github at all. 
In the folder called _HallGameProgress there is what I have, Move it outside the project in unity if unity wants to kill you over it or is
experiencing major issues/crashes.

If it warns you that the file is a different version (I.e a pop-up reads "The saved project(2021.3.10f1) does not match the launched editor
(2021.1.4f1), or something similar) it is alright as long as it is near or close to this version. If a file or function no longer works
it could be an incompatible or different version causing the issue.

I would absolutely love any additional changes on how to upload and change things in github once class starts again on Thursday.

Thanks for reading, and reach out to me on Discord if any other problems are there or persist.
